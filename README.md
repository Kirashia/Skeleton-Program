# Skeleton-Program for AQA Assessment 2018
The contents of this repository are part of the AQA A Level Syllabus (2018). The skeleton code was to be edited and improved upon over a year of development, then during the final exam the original code would be presented. The students would then have to make similar changes to the code as they did to their own versions.
There is also a file containing basic code for sorting algorithms: Binary, Merge and Radix sorts.
